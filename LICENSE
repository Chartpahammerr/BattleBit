Standalone .exe — no injector needed, run as admin and deploy.  
Works on latest BattleBit Remastered (post-2025 patches, BattlEye active).

- Humanized closet: smoothing, FOV limits, visibility checks  
- Kernel BattlEye bypass — streamproof overlays  
- ESP: players, vehicles, loot crates, objectives thru massive maps  
- Updates post-patch  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam)
